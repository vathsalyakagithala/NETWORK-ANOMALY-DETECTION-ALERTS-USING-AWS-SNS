# üö® NETWORK ANOMALY DETECTION ALERTS USING AWS SNS

## üß† About the Project

**Network Anomaly Detection Alerts using AWS SNS** is a smart monitoring system that detects unusual patterns or behaviors in network or system data using machine learning and statistical models. It aims to proactively identify anomalies such as traffic spikes, login anomalies, or suspicious activities that could signal security threats or system malfunctions. Upon detection, it instantly sends real-time alerts using **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)** via email. This rapid alert mechanism enables quicker response and enhances operational awareness for IT, DevOps, and cybersecurity teams. The system is lightweight, configurable, and integrates easily into both real-time and batch-processing environments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Automated Anomaly Detection**  
  Uses machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, statistical methods) to detect outliers or abnormal patterns in system/network data.

- üö® **Real-Time Alerts with AWS SNS**  
  Sends instant alerts via **AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)** through SMS, email when anomalies are detected.

- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Native Integration**  
  Built to work seamlessly with AWS services like SNS, and can be extended to other services (e.g., S3, Lambda, CloudWatch).
